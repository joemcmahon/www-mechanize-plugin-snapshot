Revision history for WWW-Mechanize-Plugin-Snapshot

0.17  Fri Apr 14 15:11:55 PDT 2006
	- accidentally included pre-built man page, which confuses
	  Cygwin mightily
	- test count off by 1 in XML tests

0.16  Tue Mar 21 17:23:17 PST 2006
	- added automatic type discovery for XML content.
	  This allows XML returns to show properly in
	  snapshots.
	- reversed 'horizontal' and 'vertical' layouts
	  to match the documentation (and common sense)

0.15  Tue Mar 21 16:50:49 PST 2006
	- change snapshot_layout to snap_layout for
	  consistency with the simple_scan plugin

0.14  Mon Mar 20 17:31:32 PST 2006
	- add option to allow different layouts to
	  be used (still predefined, but you get a choice)
	- fix tests to clean up after themselves
        - removed excessive diags

0.13  Tue Dec  6 16:38:44 PST 2005
	- change CSS in debug info to not use Impact
	  (Users: "too clunky!"). Differing visions.

0.12  Fri Dec  2 16:46:23 PST 2005
	- Code is still too fast. (This is a problem?!)
	  Changed to using a version counter that adds 
	  a -1, -2, etc. to the filename instead of 
          depending on the program being "slow enough"

0.11  Fri Dec  2 15:49:28 PST 2005
	- change colors in debug to something less loud.
	- Add millisecods to timestamp (fast-running
	  programs can clobber snapshots made close together)

0.10  Fri Dec  2 13:48:04 PST 2005
        - Reorder code to ensure that the run directory 
	  timestamp stays consistent

0.09  Fri Dec  2 12:47:29 PST 2005
	- Fix inconsistency between snapped files and
	  links in the frame file

0.08  Thu Dec  1 11:49:09 PST 2005
	- Fix inconsistency in filename between 
	  generated files and references in the frame file

0.07  Thu Dec  1 11:42:11 PST 2005
	- changed method name to snap_prefix
	  (easier to remember)

0.06  Thu Dec  1 10:52:22 PST 2005
	- Minor reorganization to simplify name generation
	- Fix a bug with single-digit day of month
	- Remove extraneous double-slashes from files/URLs
	  generated with leaders

0.05  Wed Nov 30 17:00:40 PST 2005
	- added snap_leader so we can customize the
	  file location for reporting by simple_scan
	- new tests for snap_leader

0.04  Wed Nov 30 13:17:50 2005
	- Snap directory now timestamped per run
	- timestamps now human-readable

0.03  Tue Nov 22 13:07:30 2005
	- remove Inline::Files dependency; not 
	  dependable enough

0.02  Fri Nov  4 14:06:13 2005 
	- Updated interface
	  -- Added snapshot_comment: prepost a comment
	  -- Added optional filename arg to snapshot()

0.01  Wed Nov  2 12:21:43 2005
	- Initial release.
