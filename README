WWW-Mechanize-Plugin-Snapshot version 0.01

Provides a method to allow Mech to "snapshot" an
HTML page as a frame containing the URL, the current 
contents of the cookie jar, the current contents of
the page, and any comment material that the caller 
desires.

This is a preliminary version. We're simply using
Data::Dumper to dump the interesting objects at this
point; custom formatting would be a nice thing to do.
(Patches welcome.)
